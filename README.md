# Omega-Code

Omega-Code is a **high-performance, production-ready** robotics control stack for a Raspberry Pi powered rover. The repository hosts:

- **Optimized** hardware-facing Go and Python services with advanced caching, async processing, and real-time performance monitoring
- A modern Next.js UI with React optimizations, lazy loading, and comprehensive performance tracking
- ROS launch files and simulation packages for autonomy experiments
- Bash utilities that simplify provisioning, Bluetooth PAN setup, and network diagnostics when you are in the field

Everything can run on the Pi, but the services are split so you can develop the UI on your laptop while tunnelling to the robot, or spin everything up locally with mock hardware for rapid iteration.

## Technology stack

- **Hardware**: Raspberry Pi 5 primary target (Pi 4 works with the `lgpio` compatibility layer). Optional Jetson Nano hooks exist in scripts.
- **Backend**: Go 1.22 WebSocket services, Python 3.11 controllers, FastAPI 0.111 REST endpoints, Flask-based MJPEG video streaming with OpenCV, `websockets` proxies, and ROS launch helpers.
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, React 18, TypeScript, Redux Toolkit, Radix UI, Tailwind CSS, Leaflet, and a comprehensive Jest + Cypress test suite.
- **Performance**: Redis caching, async task processing, WebSocket message batching, React memoization, lazy loading, and real-time performance monitoring.
- **Automation**: Modular autonomy controller with async mode handlers, ROS launch files, and bash orchestration scripts.

## Prerequisites

Install the tooling required for the parts you plan to work on:

- Go 1.22+
- Python 3.10+ (3.11 recommended) with `pip` (and optionally `virtualenv`)
- Node.js 18.17+ (Node 20 LTS recommended) and npm 9+
- Bash, `make`, and `git`
- **Redis** (optional, for advanced caching): `sudo apt install redis-server`
- **Performance monitoring**: `pip install psutil aiohttp`
- Optional on the Pi: `python3-picamera2`, `python3-libcamera`, `rpicam-apps`, `v4l-utils`, `python3-lgpio`, `bluez` tooling, and ROS (Noetic/Humble depending on your launch files)

## Environment configuration

1. Copy the root template if you use the helper scripts for hotspot/Bluetooth:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
2. Configure the backend services:
   ```bash
   cd servers/robot-controller-backend
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit ports, Pi/Tailscale IPs, TLS paths, origin allow-list, camera backend, etc.
   ```
3. Configure the UI environment:
   ```bash
   cd ../../ui/robot-controller-ui
   cp .env.local.example .env.local
   # Set NEXT_PUBLIC_GATEWAY_HOST, per-profile WebSocket URLs, and video stream targets.
   ```
   The UI supports `local`, `lan`, and `tailscale` profiles. Profile-specific URLs are
   derived from the `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables and can be overridden at runtime via the
   `?profile=` query parameter.

Optional: create `scripts/.env` if you want the Makefile helpers to preload operator
values such as `PHONE_MAC` or SSH hosts.

## Backend setup

From `servers/robot-controller-backend`:

```bash
# Go modules
go mod download

# Python environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The requirements file documents the apt packages you need on the Pi before installing
Python dependencies. For convenience you can also use `make venv` and
`make backend-install` from the repository root.

## Frontend setup

From `ui/robot-controller-ui`:

```bash
npm install
```

Install optional global tooling (`npm i -g wscat`) if you plan to use the Makefile
WebSocket helpers.

## Performance Monitoring

The system includes comprehensive performance monitoring and optimization features:

### Real-time Performance Dashboard
- **System Metrics**: CPU, memory, disk, and network usage
- **Application Metrics**: Response times, error rates, and throughput
- **Cache Performance**: Hit rates and efficiency statistics
- **WebSocket Health**: Connection status and latency monitoring
- **Performance Alerts**: Automatic alerts for performance issues

### Optimization Features
- **Automatic Caching**: Motor telemetry and sensor data cached with configurable TTL
- **Message Batching**: WebSocket messages grouped for reduced latency
- **Component Memoization**: React components optimized to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Async Processing**: Non-blocking operations with priority queues
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient WebSocket connection management

### Monitoring Endpoints
```bash
# Performance metrics
curl http://localhost:8081/api/performance/metrics

# Cache statistics
curl http://localhost:8081/api/performance/cache

# System information
curl http://localhost:8081/api/performance/system
```

## Running the stack

You can launch services individually or use the Makefile shortcuts (which load
environment files automatically).

### Individual components

| Component | Command | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Movement WebSocket | `cd servers/robot-controller-backend/movement && python movement_ws_server.py` | Implements movement, servo, buzzer, and autonomy hand-off logic. Honours `PORT_MOVEMENT`, `MOVEMENT_PATH`, `ROBOT_SIM`, and `ORIGIN_ALLOW`. |
| Ultrasonic WebSocket | `cd servers/robot-controller-backend/sensors && go run main_ultrasonic.go` | Streams HC-SR04 readings, supports configurable paths and origin allow-lists via `ULTRA_*` vars. |
| Line tracker feed | `cd servers/robot-controller-backend/sensors && python line_tracking_ws_server.py` | Publishes line-tracker states over WebSockets. |
| Lighting control | `cd servers/robot-controller-backend/controllers/lighting && go run main_lighting.go` | Proxies lighting commands to the privileged `run_led.sh` wrapper / Python LED controller. |
| Video server | `cd servers/robot-controller-backend && python video/video_server.py` | Flask + OpenCV MJPEG server with watchdog and placeholder frames. Configure with `VIDEO_PORT`, `CAMERA_*`, `STARTUP_RETRY_SEC`, etc. |
| FastAPI REST API | `cd servers/robot-controller-backend && uvicorn main_api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload` | Exposes `/lighting` and `/autonomy` routes composed from `api/`. |
| Gateway proxy | `cd servers/robot-controller-backend && uvicorn servers.gateway_api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 7070` | Aggregates `/ws/*`, `/video_feed`, and `/api/net/*` endpoints. Configure downstreams with `DS_MOVE`, `DS_ULTRA`, `DS_LIGHT`, `DS_LINE`, and `VIDEO_UPSTREAM`. |

### Makefile helpers

From the repository root:

```bash
# Print resolved URLs for a profile (local | lan | tailscale)
make check PROFILE=tailscale

# Start the movement server, video server, or UI using the active profile
make run-movement
make run-video
make ui-dev PROFILE=lan
```

Additional targets exist for PAN setup (`make pan`, `make mac-pan`), environment
inspection (`make env-print`), and backend installation (`make backend-install`).

### UI development

```bash
cd ui/robot-controller-ui
npm run dev
# or use the Makefile shortcut
make ui-dev PROFILE=local
```

The app listens on <http://localhost:3000> and reads WebSocket/video URLs from
`.env.local`. The network wizard and status bar display which profile is active and
let you trigger gateway actions when the backend exposes them.

### ROS tooling and orchestration

ROS launch files live under `ros/launch`, and example packages live in
`ros/robot_simulation`. The `scripts/start_robot.sh` helper shows how to bring up ROS,
launch Pi nodes over SSH, run `main_combined.go`, and start the UI on a MacBook in one
shot. Adjust the script to point at your actual package names and hosts.

## Diagnostics and field utilities

- `scripts/check_endpoints.sh` â€“ Profile-aware reachability checker for movement,
  ultrasonic, lighting, and video services.
- `servers/robot-controller-backend/diagnostics.py` â€“ Rich CLI diagnostic sweep for
  GPIO peripherals on the Pi 5 (ultrasonic, IR line tracker, LEDs, buzzer, camera, system info).
- `scripts/connect_*` â€“ Bluetooth PAN and hotspot automation scripts.

## Testing and linting

Run the suites that correspond to your changes:

- **Backend Go**: `cd servers/robot-controller-backend && go test ./...`
- **Backend Python**: activate the virtual environment and run `pytest tests/unit`,
  `pytest tests/integration`, `pytest tests/e2e`, plus `pytest tests/api` for the
  FastAPI layer.
- **Frontend**: `cd ui/robot-controller-ui && npm run lint`, `npm test`, `npx cypress run`
  (Cypress expects the backend/gateway to be running).

Continuous integration executes the same commands on pull requests.

## Contributing

Bug reports and pull requests are welcome. Please update the backend and frontend
READMEs whenever you change ports, environment variables, or the control surface so
other operators stay in sync. Review the existing scripts under `scripts/` before
adding new automationâ€”many common workflows already have helpers.
