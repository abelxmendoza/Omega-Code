"""
Threading Control Script

Provides utilities to safely stop threads by raising exceptions within them.
Use with caution: forcibly killing threads can leave resources in an uncertain state.

Functions:
- async_raise: Raises an exception in a thread by its thread ID.
- stop_thread: Requests a thread to exit.
- test: Test function to demonstrate continuous output and stopping.
